# We Raid the Base

Everybody was silent then Malek said, “Are you crazy? That’s impossible! People come in and then die.”  I said, “My grandfather found out and in every End Temple there's a tunnel that leads right to Herobrine's base.” 

*In the tunnel...*

I said, “Our job is to blow up Herobrine's base. While we are inside getting all the information, King Creeper, Alex, and Aden will construct a bomb. When the bomb is finished you come inside and blow up Herobrine’s base.” 

*On Earth...*

Steve Decided to go to the end to see Alex, his wife.

*In the End...*

Malek, Felix, and I got in Herobrine's base. Felix and I got in the vent, and Malek pretended to be a bad guy. I saw Cindy come out of a door and took a picture of her membership card.

*In the bad guy’s base...*

Felix was in a fight with Will. When the fight ended, Felix was put in prison.

*In the tunnel...*

Aden, King Creeper, and Alex were almost done, but a sinkhole opened, and Aiden and the bomb fell Down. Aden died. 

*In the bad guy’s base...*

Malek accidentally found Will who said, “Malek? Is it really you? Guards, get him!” Malek said, “I knew this was a bad idea”. Malek was put in prison.

*In the tunnel...*

Sinkholes were everywhere. Alex saw Steve, and Steve made a portal. Alex and Steve went back to Earth. Eventually King creeper made it to Herobrine’s base. He freed Malek and Felix. King creeper called me and said, “Time to blow up the base!” I said, ”But there's no bomb you will have to blow yourself up.” King Creeper said, “Then that's what I'll do,” and everyone got out. King Creeper exploded but did not come back to life. I started to cry. I felt like my team was falling apart, but also I had to stay sharp.
