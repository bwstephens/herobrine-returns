# Will or Will Not

*In the Nether...*

Will and Cindy were playing when I came. Will said, “What do you want?”  I said, “Herobrine is destroying our land.” Will said, “Herobrine is destroying the Nether, too.”  I said, “Then let's stop Herobrine once and for all!”

Cindy and I will team up to the destroy Herobrine. Cindy took off her mask. I said, “Mom?”  Cindy said, “Yes, Herobrine forced me to give up all good and take on this disguise, or else I would die.”  Then Mom got the Water Gem turned into the water God.
